Interview Hack Guide: Cracking HR Calls from TCS with a 3-Month Notice Period 💼📞

1. Naukri Profile Setup 📝

Create a fresh, updated profile ✅

Set notice period to 1 month (not 3 months) ⏳

Highlight current project as "Completed" or "In Release Phase" 🚀

Use strong keywords in headline: Full Stack Developer | Node.js | AWS | React | 6.5 YOE | Immediate Joiner 🧠💻

Upload updated resume (tailored for product-based roles) 📄

Keep profile status as "Actively Looking" — but do not enable 'Open to Work' tag publicly 🚫

Do not comment "I am interested" on LinkedIn job posts — this comes across as needy ❌

If you want to reach out to recruiters, do it professionally via email or DMs, not public comment sections 📬

You are not here to chase — you’re here to prove your worth silently but powerfully 🧘‍♂️🛡️

Stay active on LinkedIn through likes, reactions, small value posts, or thoughtful comments 💬🔥


2. Resume Creation 🖋️

Focus on tech stack, system design, real project ownership ⚙️🧩

Mention ongoing release phase and flexibility in transition 🔄

Use clean one-page format with metrics, action verbs, and client exposure 📊

Use ChatGPT for resume creation: provide it clear info about your role, experience, skills, and tech stack — it can format your resume neatly 🤖

Resume should be:

In black and white, clean formatting ⚫⚪

Maximum 2 pages 📏

Bullet points only 🔫

Content must be crisp, professional, and relevant to your target job role 🎯



3. When HR Calls: Handling the Notice Period Question ☎️

HR Question: "What’s your notice period?"

Suggested Response:

> "You probably already know — TCS, being an MNC, has a 3-month notice period. But I’m already released from the project, and I’m in good books with my manager. I’ve been in regular talks with leadership and I’m currently on bench, getting paid without assigned work. I can comfortably join within 1 to 1.5 months." 🧑‍💼🤝



Add-ons (if HR asks further):

"I’ve already aligned things internally to make transition smooth." 🧩

"I’ve helped with KT and the team is well set — just awaiting official exit." 🚪


4. Why We Set Naukri to 1 Month 🧠🎭

Everyone knows TCS has a 3-month notice period — it’s an open secret in the industry 🧾

But this is where reverse psychology comes in ♟️

You set it to 1 month to make your profile too good to ignore — HRs will feel the need to call you and confirm, and that call becomes your playground 🎯🎙️

If you just write 3 months — you come across as unapproachable, too rigid, and poor at communication ❌🗣️

A strong profile with a short notice creates curiosity + urgency 🚨

And when they call, you control the narrative: you explain you're on release, you joke a bit, you show you're open, honest, flexible 🤝😄


> HRs don’t always shortlist based on facts — they shortlist based on perceived interest and confidence. 🧠✨



Be real. Be you. 🙌

Crack a light joke if it fits 😂

Show energy in your voice 🎤

Ask questions too — this shows confidence and flips the power dynamic 🔁


> Remember, it’s not just an interview. It’s a mutual exchange. The more questions you ask, the more seriously you’re taken. ⚖️



5. Visibility Strategy (Beyond Naukri) 🔍

Start engaging on LinkedIn: like posts, comment "congrats" and react on meaningful updates 💡🎉

Optionally share small updates or random thoughts to appear active 🧠💬

Daily activity increases recruiter visibility 📈

Maintain your GitHub profile: regularly push your practice code, even small ones, to build an active public footprint 💻📂


6. Case Handling: What If Your Actual Notice Is 3 Months? 🎯

Case 1: You Resign Right After Getting First Offer 📩

Update your Naukri profile to "Notice Served" 🟢

You'll start getting more calls with serious interest 📲

Use the first offer letter to attract more offers 💼

Share the offer with other companies to increase your market value 📈

Within 1.5 months, you’ll likely have multiple offers 🏆

If needed, delay joining original company slightly using emotional/professional justification ⌛


Case 2: You Get Only One Offer and Delay Happens 😬

Say: "I’m ready but my manager is stalling the process. I’m caught up in internal approvals but already committed emotionally and practically." 🤷‍♂️

Express minor panic, but always sound under control 🧘

The company has already invested 1.5 months in your hiring — they’ll likely stretch to 2+ months if needed 💼📆

Meanwhile, keep applying and interviewing to get another job 🎯

If worst-case happens, be honest and say: "Only 3 weeks left in notice. I’ll join the moment it clears."

95% chances they'll wait — they’ve already invested in you 🧾💰


Case 3: You Don’t Get Any Job and First Company Rejects ❌

Revoke your resignation from TCS (yes, this is possible) 🔄

Remember: It’s your job, your career — not family-level commitment 🛡️

This is normal in today’s job market. Many people test waters 🌍

Learn from it, reset, and restart stronger — the world is switching roles like this all the time 🔥🔁


7. Bonus Pointers 🎁

"I’ve already told my manager I’m preparing for a move — they’re supportive." 🤝

"This 1.5 month estimate is genuine — I don’t want to mislead anyone." 🧠🗓️


8. Final Truth 🔐

> You’re still getting paid, not doing work, and on good terms. That’s leverage. Use it with confidence. 💰🧘‍♂️
