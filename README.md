Interview Hack Guide: Cracking HR Calls from TCS with a 3-Month Notice Period 💼📞


---

1. Naukri Profile Setup 📝

Create a fresh, updated profile ✅

Set notice period to 1 month (not 3 months) ⏳

Highlight current project as "Completed" or "In Release Phase" 🚀

Use strong keywords in headline: Full Stack Developer | Node.js | AWS | React | 6.5 YOE | Immediate Joiner 🧠💻

Upload updated resume (tailored for product-based roles) 📄

Avoid setting status to 'Actively Looking' — let your profile speak silently through smart keywords and timing 🛑

Do not comment "I am interested" on LinkedIn job posts — this comes across as needy ❌

Reach out via email or DM professionally 📬

Stay active on LinkedIn through likes, reactions, small value posts, or thoughtful comments 💬🔥

2. Resume Creation 🖋️

Focus on tech stack, system design, real project ownership ⚙️🧩

Mention release phase and flexibility in transition 🔄

Use ChatGPT for resume formatting: provide clear info on role, experience, and tech stack 🤖

Resume formatting tips:

Black and white, clean formatting ⚫⚪

Maximum 2 pages 📏

Use bullet points only 🔫

Crisp, relevant content only 🎯

3. Handling the HR Call: Notice Period Question ☎️

HR Question: "What’s your notice period?"

Suggested Response:

> "You probably already know — TCS, being an MNC, has a 3-month notice period. But I’m already released from the project, and I’m in good books with my manager. I’ve been in regular talks with leadership and I’m currently on bench, getting paid without assigned work. I can comfortably join within 1 to 1.5 months." 🧑‍💼🤝



Add-ons:

"I’ve aligned things internally for a smooth transition." 🧩

"KT is done and the team is ready — just awaiting official exit." 🚪

4. Why We Set Naukri to 1 Month 🧠🎭

Everyone knows TCS notice is 3 months — it’s an open secret 🧾

This is reverse psychology ♟️

You set 1 month to make your profile too good to ignore — HRs will want to call and confirm 🎯

That’s your playground — where you control the narrative 🎙️

Writing 3 months shows lack of communication and reduces shortlisting chances ❌🗣️

Strong profile + short notice = curiosity + urgency 🚨


Be real. Be you. 🙌

Use humor if needed 😂

Show high energy 🎤

Ask questions — confidence booster 🔁


> Interviews are a mutual exchange. More questions = more confidence ⚖️

5. Visibility Strategy (Beyond Naukri) 🔍

Engage on LinkedIn: Like, comment, and support 🎉

Share short posts, insights, learnings 🧠💬

Update GitHub consistently with practice projects 💻📂



---

6. Case Handling: Actual Notice is 3 Months 🎯

Case 1: Resign After First Offer 📩

Change Naukri status to "Notice Served" 🟢

Use first offer letter to gain leverage for more 💼

Share with others to amplify interest 📈

You’ll likely have multiple offers in 1.5 months 🏆


Case 2: Delay from Manager 😬

Say: "I’m ready but caught in internal delays." 🤷‍♂️

Act slightly panicked but stay in control 🧘

They've already invested 1.5 months — most will wait 📆

Continue applying actively to secure backup 🎯

Worst case? Say: "Only 3 weeks left, I’ll join soon." 💪


Case 3: No Offers, Rejected Later ❌

Revoke resignation from TCS 🔄

Not a personal failure — just a strategic reset 🛡️

Most people test the waters — no guilt 🌊

Learn, regroup, and restart stronger 🔥



---

7. Bonus Pointers 🎁

"Manager already knows I’m preparing — supportive." 🤝

"1.5 months is genuine — I’m not misleading anyone." 🧠🗓️



---

8. Final Truth 🔐

> You’re being paid, not working, and you're in control. That’s leverage. 💰🧘‍♂️
